# Zslicy

I kinda think a lot of slicers suck ass cheeks, so I made my own <br>

Slicers are simple things, but of course I wouldn't be an 
engineer if I couldn't overcomplicate the everliving shit 
out of it.<br>

## bloop bloop

The idea is to take a file of type *.stl, *.STL
and spit out a file *.gcode, *.GCODE <br>

The GCode should be Marlin flavor

I using GTest library to create Test cases <br>
The code is written in C++ <br>
The code is built with CMake<br>
